2.-Second day of the 100day challenge:
	Warm up:
		-2 digit addition.
		-BMI Calculator.
		-Age calculator (This is the simplest version: when you JUST turned that age, not even one day after).
	Day 2 code:
		-Tip calculator.
3.-Third day of the 100day challenge:
	Warm up:

		-Pizza delivery program.
		-Love calculator.
	Day 3 code:
		-Choose your own story.
4.-Fourth day of the 100day challenge:
	Warm up:
		-Random number generator.
		-Coin Toss.
		-Treasure map.
	Day 4 code:
		-Rock, paper, scissors.
5.-Fifth day of the 100day challenge:
	Warm up:
		-Student heights average.
		-Highest exam score.
		-Addition of all the even numbers in a range of numbers.
		-FizzBuzz game.
	Day 5 code:
		-Password generator.
6.-Sixth day of the 100day challenge:
	Warm up:
		-Hurdle 1 (Reeborg's World).
		-Hurdle 2 (Reeborg's World).
		-Hurdle 3 (Reeborg's World).
		-Hurdle 4 (Reeborg's World).
	Day 6 code:
		-Maze runner (Reeborg's World).
7.-Seventh day of the 100day challenge:
	Day 7 code:
		-Hangman (My way)
		-Hangman (Professor's way)
8.-Eigth day of the 100day challenge:
	Warm up:
		-Functions with arguments, and keyword arguments.
	Day 8 code:
		-Caesar Cipher (1).
		-Caesar Cipher (2).
		-Caesar Cipher (3).
9.-Nineth day of the 100day challenge:
	Warm up:
		-How to use dictionaries.
		-How to use one of the dictionary methods, plus dictionary unpacking.
		-Nesting lists and dictionaries.
		-Function that add new countries to the old list of dictionaries.
	Day 9 code:
		-Blind auction: It asks the user for their name, their bid, and if there
		 is another user. If there is, then the entire process starts again.
		 After every iteration, the code updates a dictionary with "names" and "bid"
		 prices values.
	 -A little over complicated at the end, but it does the job correctly: outputs
	  the auctions winner. (wins the highest price).
	 -Teachers way of solving it: Even though the 2 versions of code are mostly
    different, in core logic, none of them are wrong or incorrect. They just
		tackle the problem differently. Maybe you want the keys and the values as
		lists, to later refferencing and indexing a list; choice 1. Or maybe you
		just needed a key value pair, where the keys are all the names and the
		values are all the bid prices; choice 2. Either is correct, it just depends
		on what you need afterwards. At the end, both versions output the same
		correct answer.
10.-Tenth day of the 100day challenge:
===============================================================================
	Warm up:
		-How to write a function that returns a value (I already did that in many
		 of my previous codes, but this is officially the first one).
		-This is how you have multiple returns inside a function.
		-This is the same 'leap year' program I coded earlier, but now it has multiple
		 functions with multiple return statements.
		 -How to make DocStrings.
	Day 10 code:
		-I am trying to get used to log every new working change in the code. So,
		 right now the only thing that is coded are the functions and all the tests
		 for debugging purposes.
		-Problem solved: Now it does not ask for the input operator twice (I forgot
		 to add it to the read me). The code loops twice the code with a 'for loop'
		 and works as intended: Asks the user for 2 numbers, what operation to use
		 and outputs the results. Then asks if the user wants to use the old result
		 for a new operation and starts the loop again.
		 Now I realize I should have also added how the code worked without a loop,
		 for referencing. Good to know for next time.
		-Works better with a while loop.
		-If the user inputs the wrong special character, then the calculator closes.
		-Final code (My way).
