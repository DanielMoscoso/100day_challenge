	Day 8 code:
		-Caesar Cipher (1).
		-Caesar Cipher (2).
		-Caesar Cipher (3).
9.-Nineth day of the 100day challenge:
===============================================================================
	Warm up:
		-How to use dictionaries.
		-How to use one of the dictionary methods, plus dictionary unpacking.
		-Nesting lists and dictionaries.
		-Function that add new countries to the old list of dictionaries.
	Day 9 code:
		-Blind auction: It asks the user for their name, their bid, and if there
		 is another user. If there is, then the entire process starts again.
		 After every iteration, the code updates a dictionary with "names" and "bid"
		 prices values.
	 -A little over complicated at the end, but it does the job correctly: outputs
	  the auctions winner. (wins the highest price).
	 -Teachers way of solving it: Even though the 2 versions of code are mostly
    different, in core logic, none of them are wrong or incorrect. They just
		tackle the problem differently. Maybe you want the keys and the values as
		lists, to later refferencing and indexing a list; choice 1. Or maybe you
		just needed a key value pair, where the keys are all the names and the
		values are all the bid prices; choice 2. Either is correct, it just depends
		on what you need afterwards. At the end, both versions output the same
		correct answer.
